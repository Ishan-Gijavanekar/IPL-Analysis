 🏏 IPL Match Analysis Project

 📌 Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of IPL match-level data from `matches.csv`. Using Python and data visualization libraries, we explore team performance, toss impact, player achievements, venue trends, and more.


 📂 Dataset
- **File**: `matches.csv`
- **Description**: Contains match-level data including season, teams, toss decisions, results, venues, and player of the match.
- **Source**: [Specify if from Kaggle or manually compiled]



 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze team performance across seasons
- Explore toss decisions and their impact on match outcomes
- Identify top-performing players
- Visualize win margins and trends
- Understand venue-wise and season-wise dynamics



 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)



 📈 Key Analyses Performed
- Top teams by win count
- Toss winner vs match winner correlation
- Most frequent Player of the Match winners
- Win margins by runs and wickets
- Venue popularity and performance
- Season-wise match distribution
- Correlation heatmaps and boxplots



 ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Ensure `matches.csv` is in the same directory
3. Run the notebook or script:
   ```bash
   python ipl_analysis.py
   ```
   or open `ipl_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter



 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Bar plots of top teams and players
- Heatmaps of numerical correlations
- Boxplots for toss decision impact
- Line plots for season trends


 💡 Future Enhancements
- Integrate ball-by-ball data for deeper insights
- Add predictive modeling (e.g., win prediction)
- Build a Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration
